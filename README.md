## AI in Software Engineering: Loveable

[Why you should join: Loveable](https://whyyoushouldjoin.substack.com/p/lovable)

Technological advances are changing the ways that software engineers work.
When ChatGPT was released, it could help write HTML or CSS documents.
Since its release in 2022, countless new AI technologies have been released every month, fundamentally changing the role of the software engineer.
Organizations such as workplaces and educational institutions have had to create procedures on how they plan to
adapt or reject these advancements.

Loveable is an AI platform that is able to generate full apps simply with a prompt. It has gained significant traction
raising over 550 million to "empower the builder." While Loveable allows you to be able to easily create these apps, I believe more consideration into scalability and maintainability of the apps that are created.

Albert Chen (azc9673): This article really resonates with what many CS students and SWEs are seeing today: AI tools like Lovable can drastically lower the barrier of entry for coding, but it still cannot completely replace seasoned and skilled developers. Key conceptual concepts like requirement analysis, testing, scalability, etc. that we've covered in class already are vitally important for a fully functional development, and are yet to be solved and integrated into these AI coding tools. Thus, SWEs must learn to utilize these tools as accelerators and assistants to their work, rather than constantly worrying about them replacing SWEs entirely.
